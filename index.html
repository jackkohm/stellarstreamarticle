            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>The Milky Way, a vast and intricate galaxy, has evolved over billions of years. Stellar streams, continuous stretches of stars that orbit galaxies, have emerged as promising tools in the archaeological endeavor of decoding the galaxy's history. These streams are remnants of smaller galaxies or star clusters torn apart by the Milky Way's gravitational forces.</p>

            <h2>Galactic Interactions and Morphological Transformations</h2>
            <p>Observational aspects of galactic dynamics provide information on the current positions and velocities of cosmological objects, with the seminal work by Toomre and Toomre delving into the phenomena of galactic bridges and tails.</p>

            <h2>Debris Streams and the Milky Way's Formation</h2>
            <p>Helmi et al.'s 1999 work explored the remnants of debris streams, proposing them as relics of the Milky Way's formation process, confirmed through simulation studies and observational data.</p>

            <h2>Challenges in Simulating Galaxy Formation</h2>
            <p>Simulating the formation and evolution of galaxies presents numerous challenges, including numerical errors and the complexity of accurately modeling dynamical systems.</p>

            <h2>Observable Effects of Resonances on Stellar Streams</h2>
            <p>The paper by Yavetz et al. proposed that the morphology of stellar streams is influenced not only by external perturbations but also by internal resonances, offering new insights into the gravitational potential of galaxies.</p>
